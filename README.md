# Code.org Projects

This repository is a central link hub to a few projects I made in JavaScript using code.org's app maker lab. They demonstrate some technical ability (basic JavaScript) but moreso showcase some GUI and app design I'm proud of.

# Large Projects
These projects took a long time to develop and feature a lot of pages to navigate and features within them.
1. [Bee Keeper Tycoon](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/uXzeOUnb43GIFuoJ8-uxDO-GL5-4hYgRqgb0eq2W5Lg) A game about catching bees, taking care of them in hives, and selling what they make to fund your farm.
2. [Painting Expanded](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/6WNJJUVrZulNhgNJzEmhyw) A painting app I created. It has the ability to choose any color and use a variety of brushes.

# Medium Projects
These projects took only a couple days but still look nice and function properly.
1. [Snails](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/5zkx42Op7Yy_ycMHNn8rtA) A visual information app filled with various facts about snails.
2. [Firefly Catching Game](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/WCyiHQS7wc47SOepM6mVzQ) A simple clicker game where I learned how to use click events.

# Small Projects
These were done relatively quickly in conjunction with a separate project.
1. [Black Hole](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/-Pb5hAZyIiJbN4fB7YY2AQ) Draws a neat black hole on a canvas. This was combined with other drawing programs to create an entire space scene.
2. [Blocking Experiment Recreated](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/snv3eWgsq2GmKpnPbbK9DFtDyQEV3AZ3nqshRY2bQRM) I remade a psychology experiment we covered in class in JavaScript.
<details>
  <summary>Explanation</summary>
  Users must sort character strings into either the left or right group based on a set of rules (whether there is a R or L for right or left group). After 10 correct choices, a second stage begins with a new additional rule based on B or F (B matches groups for R, F matches groups for L). After another 10 correct choices, users are asked in person to identify what group the final string goes in without the R or L character. No participant can sort the strong based on the new B or F rule because the brain blocks out new patterns once it locks onto a new one.

3. [Control Experiment Recreated](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/8lutr-Kq7Ps1DOIH-2DdcnkZxxAmeBxf3z1NmvZUz_0) Another experiment, users are asked to manipulate the following scene to have the light be on as much as possible. For an explanation, see below.

  <summary>Explanation</summary>
  The light blinks for 1 second every 5 seconds by itself. A player can instantly toggle the light for 1 second, but it will miss the next 2 automatic turn ons resulting in a lower overall score. However, because they percieve their actions controlling the light about half of the partcipants continually push the button to trigger the light.
